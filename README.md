# getcities

- convert.js: extracted all the cities from cities.json, then put it in a file called `frenchCities.txt`. I modified it to convert this file into an Array in `frenchCities.json`.
- analyze.js: This will search all keywords in `data.csv` to check if they contain a city, then create an `output.csv` file with the category column filled in if it's a city.
